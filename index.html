                                    in the morning and the second half in the evening. A stable routine of feeding can also help you with house training. Dogs usually have to go to the bathroom 20 - 30 minutes after eating.</p>

                                    puppy dog eyes. However, stick to your guns!
                                    <br>Don't feed your dog food that is bad for it. There are many foods that are not only bad for your dog but that can be hazardous to its health. Do not give your dog any chocolate, avocado, bread dough, raisins, grapes,
                                    onions, or xylitol, which is a non-caloric sweetener.

                want to look for a new one. Feel free to change veterinarians even after you take your dog to one. Remember, you should also know of an emergency vet that's open 24 hours a day and on weekends.</p>
